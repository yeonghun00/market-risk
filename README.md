# **Market Risk Analysis Using Python**

This project focuses on analyzing current market conditions by applying a range of quantitative techniques commonly used in **market risk management**. It uses Python to implement models and simulations that assess market risk through volatility forecasting, stress testing, and scenario analysis. The goal is to provide insights into potential losses and extreme market behaviors, using tools that are frequently employed in financial risk management and outlined in the **FRM (Financial Risk Manager)** curriculum.

### **Key Models and Techniques:**

1. **Risk Measurement Tools:**
   - **Value at Risk (VaR):** Estimates the potential loss in a portfolio over a given time period with a specified confidence level.
   - **Expected Shortfall (ES):** Extends VaR by calculating the average loss beyond the VaR threshold, giving a more robust measure of extreme risk.

2. **Volatility Modeling and Forecasting:**
   - **GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity):** Models time-varying volatility based on historical data, capturing volatility clustering in financial markets.
   - **EWMA (Exponentially Weighted Moving Average):** A simpler volatility estimation model that places more weight on recent data.
   - **ARCH (Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity):** Focuses on periods of high and low volatility by using past error terms to predict future volatility.

3. **Time Series Forecasting:**
   - **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average):** A forecasting model that captures trends, seasonality, and patterns in historical market data.
   - **Monte Carlo Simulation:** Simulates a wide range of potential market outcomes based on historical returns, useful for assessing risk in uncertain market conditions.

4. **Scenario and Stress Testing:**
   - **Stress Testing:** Evaluates how assets or portfolios perform under extreme but plausible market conditions, such as financial crises or sharp interest rate movements.
   - **Copula Models:** Capture the dependency structure between different assets or markets, especially under stress, to evaluate correlation risk.

5. **Specialized Market Models:**
   - **Volatility Surface:** A visualization that shows implied volatility across different strike prices and maturities, commonly used in options pricing.
   - **LPPL (Log-Periodic Power Law) Model:** A tool for predicting financial bubbles and crashes by identifying self-reinforcing patterns in market data.

### **Objective:**
This project aims to provide a comprehensive toolkit for assessing market risk using both traditional and advanced quantitative techniques. It will serve as a resource for finance professionals, data scientists, and students interested in market risk analysis, volatility forecasting, and financial modeling.

### **How to Use:**
1. Clone the repository or run it in **Google Colab** to experiment with real-world financial data.
2. Load your own financial data or use sample datasets provided.
3. Use the provided scripts to calculate key risk metrics like VaR, Expected Shortfall, and run stress tests or simulations to understand market risk exposure.
